# KWOK (Kubernetes-WithOut-Kubelet)

The repository is a toolkit that enables setting up a cluster of thousands of Nodes in seconds.
Under the scene, all Nodes are simulated to behave like real ones, so the overall approach employes
a pretty low resource footprint that you can easily play around on your laptop.

So far we provide two tools:

- **Kwok:** core of this repo. It simulates thousands of fake Nodes.
- **Kwokctl:** A CLI to facilitate creating and managing clusters simulated by Kwok.

## Get started

The following examples are tested to work with the latest version of Kwok/Kwokctl.

### Basic Usage

- [Kwok Manage Nodes and Pods](./docs/examples/kwok-manage-nodes-and-pods.md) - Kwok's basic management of Node and Pod operations
- Kwok - maintain Nodes heartbeat and Pods status.
  - [Kwok in Cluster](./docs/examples/kwok-in-cluster.md) - Installing Kwok in a cluster
  - [Kwok in Local](./docs/examples/kwok-in-local.md) - Run Kwok in the local for a cluster
- Kwokctl - cluster creation, etcd snapshot, etc.
  - [Kwokctl Manage Clusters](./docs/examples/kwokctl-manage-cluster.md) - Create/Delete a cluster in local where all nodes are managed by Kwok
  - [Kwokctl Snapshot Cluster](./docs/examples/kwokctl-snapshot.md) - Save/Restore the Etcd data of a cluster created by Kwokctl

``` console
$ time kwokctl create cluster
Creating cluster "kwok-kwok"
Starting cluster "kwok-kwok"
Cluster "kwok-kwok" is ready
You can now use your cluster with:

    kubectl config use-context kwok-kwok

Thanks for using kwok!

```

### Actual Usage

If you are using Kwok/Kubectl as a testing or CI in your project and would like to share your experience with others, then please add your example below

## Kwokctl Runtime and OS Support

Runtime indicates which medium kwokctl will use to start the cluster
